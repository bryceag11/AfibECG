# AfibECG
Signal Processing Project for detection of AFib in ECG data

Open-source data was acquired from Physionet and analyzed using various filters and an altered Pan Tompkins algorithm (Pan & Tompkins, 1985), for the identification of ECG segments.The most important information was gained from the extraction of the ECG features as this is what allows for one to perform further analysis and detect AF within normal sinus rhythm. Suggested next steps are to further this algorithm to accurately measure AF episodes through the location identification of AF episode onset and end.
